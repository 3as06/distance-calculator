Design and implement web service (REST) application for distance calculation:
    Database holds two entities:
    1.City
        -Name
        -Latitude
        -Longitude
    2.Distance
  	    -From city
        -To city
        -Distance
Application should make it possible to calculate the distance in two ways:
    1.Crowflight� (straight distance) between cities. Lookup formula for distance calculation on the sphere in the internet.
    2.Lookup distance between two cities via distance matrix (distance table in the database)
API has 3 endpoints:
    1.List of all cities in the DB. Fields:
	    -ID
	    -Name
    2.Calculate distance
        -Input:
	        Calculation Type: <Crowflight, Distance Matrix, All>
        	From City: <List of cities>
	        To City: <List of Cities>
	    -Output:
	        Results: all distance calculation results as requested
	3.Upload data to the DB. Uploads XML file with cities and distances into the application. Application parses it and stores it into the database.
	    -Input:
	        Multipart/form-data form submission with single �File� input.
	    -Output:
	        HTTP response code 200 without body
